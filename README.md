# Expanded Project Overview
Problem Background (Detailed)
# Context:

Food Fraud: 30% of food products are mislabeled globally (fish, olive oil, organic produce)

Supply Chain Opacity: Consumers have no verifiable way to track food origins

Quality Control Gaps: Manual inspections are subjective and can be bypassed

Recall Inefficiency: When contamination occurs, tracing the source takes days/weeks

Research Problem: How to create an automated, tamper-proof food supply chain system that integrates AI-powered quality verification at each custody transfer point while maintaining scalability and user accessibility.

Existing Solutions & Their Limitations:

Simple QR Codes: Easily forged, no real-time verification

Centralized Databases: Single point of failure, vulnerable to manipulation

Manual Paper Trails: Slow, prone to human error, easily lost/damaged

Basic Blockchain Tracking: Records transfers but lacks automated quality validation
